# Style Guide #

Here lie the heretofore-unwritten rules and styles we use when writing
documentation, issues, pull requests, and other forms of written expression.

## Repositories ##

**All repositories should be public.**

Whether creating new repositories or transferring existing repositories,
remember that we work in the open by default. For more, when we might use
private repositories, read our [open source policy](https://github.com/cisagov/development-guide/tree/develop/open-source-policy).

### Repository naming ###

Use a repository's name to describe its purpose. Names should be:

1. Descriptive
1. Readable
1. Consistent
1. Contextual
1. Future-friendly
1. Extensible
1. Reusable

Avoid references to pop culture or other implicit references. GitLab has a
good guide on using [inclusive language in documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#inclusive-language).

Specifically, when naming a repository:

- Use lower case
- Use dashes
  - For readability, where spaces would otherwise separate words
  - Avoid underscores, which require extra keystrokes

### Repository settings ###

Specify code owners in each repository's `.github/codeowners` file to make
sure that changes and pull requests are reviewed by people familiar with
the codebase. This way, we'll catch more problems before they get into the
protected branch.

- Set a minimum of two code owners for all repositories.
  - Add or edit each repository's `.github/codeowners` file.
- Set up [branch protection](project_setup/branch-protection.md).

## Headers and headings ##

Use sentence case. For example:

- `# Use variables to configure pipelines`
- `## Use the Style Guide`

## Lists ##

Use bulleted lists unless order matters, in which case use numbered lists.

Always capitalize the first word of list items, unless theyâ€™re parameters or
commands that are in backticks, or a similar situation.

### List punctuation ###

Periods or no periods?

- Use periods at the end of bullets that are full sentences.
- Omit periods at the end of partial sentences.
- Match the rest of the bulleted or numbered list as much as possible.

## Code blocks ##

When formatting code blocks, use the formatting that best highlights the
syntax in the code block.

We generally use code blocks for scripts, command-line usage, and when showing
file contents like configuration files.

### Scripts ###

- Use `shell` formatting for shell scripts
  - `shell` is also aliased as `sh`, `bash`, `zsh`, and others
- Use language-specific formatting, such as `python`, for blocks with scripts
written in specific languages
  - Reference the [GitHub list of supported languages](https://github.com/github/linguist/blob/master/lib/linguist/languages.yml)

### Command-line ###

- `console` is most effective at highlighting a command _and_ its resulting
output, like this:

    ```console
    $ the_first_command
    the output
    more output
    $ the_second_command
    yet more output
    ```

- `shell` should be used for result-less commands, _especially_ if
there is any shell-fu like pipes, file redirects, shell variables, etc. to
apply syntax highlighting so the reader is more aware of the magic happening

### File contents ###

- Extension-specific formatting, such as `hcl` for Terraform, should be used
