# CISA Open Source Policy #

In general, we work in the open by default.

**[Read CISA's open source policy](policy.md)** for the official [Open Source Policy](policy.md) of [CISA](https://cisa.gov/) and more details about what "open by default" means.

## CISA Team Guidance ##

**[Read CISA's open source team practices](practice.md)** for guidance on how CISA puts this open-by-default policy into practice, and how we handle the narrow situations where we may delay or withhold the release of source code.
