# Onboarding Checklist #

## Instructions ##

When someone new joins the team:

1. A team member adds the new team member to the `cisagov` organization in
GitHub.
1. Create a new issue called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
1. View the raw source of this file.
1. Copy the text after the line to the issue, replacing "NewPerson" with the
new person's name and "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
1. Remove any block of tasks that doesn't apply to the new team member's role
1. Submit the issue.
1. Assign the new person and the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the issue.
1. Move the issue into _In Progress_.

---

To get NewPerson productively contributing to the team, Buddy should help
NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions ##

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist
personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct_
_access completes that item_.

## New Person checklist ##

### Getting to know VM Fusion ###

- [ ] Take judicious notes on what about your onboarding process is confusing
or frustrating.
  - Please share this information with your buddy (or the team) so we can make
  things better.
  - If you notice a problem (especially with things like documentation), you
  are more than welcome to fix it!
  - You can also file issues and pull requests on the [template onboarding checklist]
- [ ] Figure out who your onboarding buddy is (they should reach out to you).
- [ ] Once you've finished the checklists below, make suggestions for steps
that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on the
[template onboarding checklist] used to make this issue.

### Required items for all team members ###

Completing these items helps us fulfill security and compliance requirements.
If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from
your onboarding buddy.

Pre-requisites:

- [ ] Complete [PALMS Cybersecurity Training](https://etms.hq.dhs.gov),
including Mandatory Cyber Security and Privacy Training, including accepting
the Rules of Behavior, which is required before we can give you access to any
systems, like Trio.
- [ ] Go through the [FISMA-Ready Github guide](https://github.com/fisma-ready/github)
to set up your Github account to be added to CISA

### Microsoft Teams chat ###

Once you're set up on Microsoft Teams, we recommend you join the following:

- [ ] [CISA](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa40fd338ea7a45de994a7c7ce9671fd4%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=8c6c0b00-7244-46e1-bef9-76ce2a1906f5&tenantId=3ccde76c-946d-4a12-bb7a-fc9d0842354a)
- [ ] [CISA - VM- Fusion Branch](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a2d4e9f3e321f4ef9a09f4ed94a32105c%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=2992771f-df53-4097-87dd-75898a5830db&tenantId=3ccde76c-946d-4a12-bb7a-fc9d0842354a)

### Getting to know the VM Fusion Dev Team ###

- [ ] Bookmark the [dev team project board] to track issues and work across
multiple Github repositories
- [ ] Bookmark [VM JIRA] to work with the rest of VM Fusion.
- [ ] In addition to your CISA email address `first.last@cisa.dhs.gov`, you'll
also get an account on Trio, which is a Google-based account used for
cross-team and cross-agency collaboration and is generally
`first.last@trio.dhs.gov`. Trio may take a few days to get set up.
  - Once you're set up on Trio, visit
  [chat.google.com](https://chat.google.com) and join applicable rooms.
- [ ] Make sure you have been added to several [dev team Google Groups] so you
can participate in team-wide internal communication:
  - [ ] [ALL Trio users@beta.dhs.gov](https://groups.google.com/a/beta.dhs.gov/d/forum/all)
  - [ ] [CISA COOL](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/forum/#!forum/cisa-cool-group)
  - [ ] [cisagov-github](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/forum/#!forum/cisagov-github-group)

- [ ] Add the [NCATS Google Drive folder] to your Google Drive. If you create
or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members
to be able to view and edit it.

## Buddy checklist ##

- [ ] Introduce yourself to the new team member and give them some of your
background so they know who you are.

their skills domain, schedule a meeting with the owner for an introduction (if
it's not you), and set up pairing sessions several times in the first week on
the project.
- [ ] Identify a straightforward, well-groomed first story, ideally something
they could conceivably complete in their first two/three weeks using their
existing skills. Discuss the context with them, then make them the assignee.

improved and open as PRs on [the onboarding template]

## Required items for all team members ##

  permissions can be correctly managed by terraform
