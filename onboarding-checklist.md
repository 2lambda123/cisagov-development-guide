that would have improved your onboarding experience as pull requests on the

If you get stuck, or if these requirements are confusing, ask for help from
your onboarding buddy.

[create a GitHub account with your government email address](https://github.com/join).

Once you're set up on Microsoft Teams, we recommend you join the following:

- [ ] [CISA](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aa40fd338ea7a45de994a7c7ce9671fd4%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=8c6c0b00-7244-46e1-bef9-76ce2a1906f5&tenantId=3ccde76c-946d-4a12-bb7a-fc9d0842354a)
- [ ] [CSD All Staff](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a65f1c4b58edf4246995ae3fa732767ee%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=6dfc3f23-3a49-44ce-ad37-6c7a9d8fb0aa&tenantId=3ccde76c-946d-4a12-bb7a-fc9d0842354a)

### Getting to know the VM Fusion Dev Team ###

- [ ] Bookmark the [dev team project board] to track issues and work across
multiple GitHub repositories.

### Trio Google Workspace ###

In addition to your CISA email address `first.last@cisa.dhs.gov`, you'll
also get an account on Trio, which is a Google Workspace account used for
cross-team and cross-agency collaboration and is generally
`first.last@trio.dhs.gov`. Trio may take a few days to get set up.

Once your Trio account is set up:

- [ ] Visit
  [chat.google.com](https://chat.google.com) and join applicable rooms.
- [ ] Make sure you have been added to several [dev team Google Groups] so you
can participate in team-wide internal communication:
  - [ ] [ALL Trio users](https://groups.google.com/a/beta.dhs.gov/d/forum/all)
  - [ ] [CISA COOL Administrators](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/forum/#!forum/cisa-cool-group)
  - [ ] [cisa-cool-account-support](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/d/forum/cisa-cool-account-support-group)
  - [ ] [cisa-cool-users](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/d/forum/cisa-cool-users-group)
  - [ ] [cisagov-github](https://groups.google.com/a/trio.dhs.gov/forum/#!forum/cisagov-github-group)

- [ ] In Google Drive, add the [NCATS Google Drive folder]. If you create
or move a doc there, it'll get the right access permissions for team members
to be able to view and edit it.
- [ ] In Google Calendar, add the [Dev Team - Events & OOO calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=beta.dhs.gov_pou7e62ob7h1qadu1m8n4o996g%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FNew_York).
