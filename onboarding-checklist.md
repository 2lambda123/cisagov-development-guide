# Onboarding Checklist

## Instructions

When someone new joins the team:

1. A team member adds the new team member to the `cisagov` organization in GitHub. This constitutes 'formal approval` by leadership
1. Create a new issue in the [somewhere??]() called "Onboard [NewPerson]".
  * Use of a private repo helps satisfy AC-2, that we have officially added a person to our team before further onboarding.
2. View the raw source of this file.
3. Copy the text after the line to the issue, replacing "NewPerson" with the new person's name and  "Buddy" with the onboarding buddy's name.
3. Remove any block of tasks that doesn't apply to the new team member's role
4. Submit the issue.
5. Assign the new person and the new person's Onboarding Buddy to the issue.
6. Put the issue into _Doing_.

---

To get NewPerson productively contributing to the team, Buddy should help NewPerson complete a prescribed set of tasks that will bring them up to speed.

## Directions

**NewPerson and Buddy:** Try to go through your checklists in order.

**Buddy:** If you canâ€™t complete any of the items on your checklist personally, _you are responsible for ensuring that someone with the correct access completes that item_.

    - Once you're set up on Trio, visit [chat.google.com](https://chat.google.com) and join applicable rooms.
- [ ] Make sure you have been added to several [dev team Google Groups] so you can participate in team-wide internal communication:
